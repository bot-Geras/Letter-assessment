    <H1>Re: Eileen Dover university apllication</H1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as
        part<br>of your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">PHD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one
        by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <H2>Starting dates</H2>

    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if
        you<br>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester:<time datetime="9-9-16">9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li>Second semester:<time datetime="15-1-17">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li>Third semester:<time datetime="2-5-17">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <u>university dates on our website.</u></p>


    <H3>Subjects of study</H3>
    <p> the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
        just<br>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
        intrigued<br>by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when
                the<br>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p9>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
        the<br>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
        Thanks.</p9>

    <H4>Exotic dance moves</H4>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question,<br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt> chicken dance<br></p>
        </dt>
        <dd>little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
            around<br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br></dd>
        <dt>brownian shuffle<br></p>
        </dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
            which<br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly<br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this
            dance inspired<br> modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>
            <p> Arctic robot dance<br></p>
        </dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to
            have<br>discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by
            inhabitants<br>of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving
            like this<br>because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl>

    <address>Yours sincerely,</address><br>
    <address>Dr Eleanor Gaye</address><br>
